//Taxes
//1.     Create the tax class, it contains 2 methods.
//
//a.    Method 1 -  which takes a salary and works out the percentage by which the salary will be taxed.
//
//b.    Method 2 - which works out the exact amount that the user will be taxed using a similar process to that in the first method. This amount should be returned and output to the console.
//
//These 2 methods should be able to work independently so it is ok if some of the code is repeated.
//
//2.    The Salaries are taxed as below:
//
//a.    0 â€“ 14999: 0% Tax
//
//b.    15000 â€“ 19999: 10% Tax
//
//c.    20000-29999: 15% Tax
//
//d.    30000-44999: 20% Tax
//
//e.    45000+: 25%: Tax
//
//3.    Finally combine the 2 methods so that the second method utilizes the first method to return the correct result.
//
//Secondly, build unit tests for this project.
//
